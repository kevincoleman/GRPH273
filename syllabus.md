# GRPH 273 - Advanced Web Design

Welcome to Advanced Web Design! We’ll be covering a lot of varied topics during this course. You’ll be building on your HTML, CSS and Photoshop skills to become comfortable with much more than the basics. It’s my hope that by studying many different aspects of advanced web design & development, each in a surface-level way, you’ll get a chance to learn about some new technologies that make you tick—and then you can go learn more on your own.

## General Subjects
Over the next ten weeks, we’ll be covering these topics, plus a few fillers or extras if anyone requests something else they’ve discovered.

* Accessing Web Servers (& Zone Files)
* Javascript
* Unix Command
* Git & GitHub
* Web Fonts
* Optimized Images
* CSS Transitions & Animations
* Client- vs. Server-side code
* Wordpress Templates


## Design Projects
You’ll also be doing a series of small design projects throughout the quarter. These will need to be client-ready Photoshop mockups, and we’ll use some of them to develop into case study sites. Some of the types of pages you’ll be designing are:

* Bio
* Gallery
* Contact Form
* Blog
* Search Results
* Long-form reading
* Small Business
* Social profile
* ...
* ?


## Quizzes
There will be a weekly quiz that covers the topic of the week (General Subjects). These Will be on D2L, and will open on Thursday after class is over. They will close On Tuesday before class starts, so you will have three non-Sabbath days to complete them. They are open book/web, and are meant mainly to help you know which key points I want to make sure you retain. However, they also contribute to your grade.


## Grades
Your grades, like most, will be made up of your efforts put forth into the class (surprise)! Here’s a breakdown of how I’ll be structuring it:

* 20% Attendance & Participation
* 30% Projects from weekly topics
* 30% Design projects and critiques
* 20% Quizzes

Each grade letter is represents a range of 10 percentage points (A = 90–100, B = 80–89, etc.). Your grades will be updated as regularly as I can keep up with, and will be available on D2L


## Final Test
Be awesome, and I might not make you do a final test (this class is heavily project-based, so it may be a final project—TBD)


## Disabilities
Those with physical and/or learning disabilities who require
special accommodations must inform the instructor and
coordinate alternative solutions with Sue Huett, Disability
Support Services in the Teaching Learning Center, Village
Hall, or at 527-2366.


## Faith & Learning
Central to the WWU mission is the integration of Faith
and Learning. This integration will be broadly approached.
Your professor may weave into the discussion various topics
such as ethics, mission work, service, and respect for God’s
creation. Adding your thoughts to these class discussions is
strongly encouraged.
