========================

Welcome to Web Design II! We’ll be covering a lot of varied topics during this course. You’ll be building on your HTML, CSS and Photoshop skills to become comfortable with much more than the basics. It’s my hope that by studying many different aspects of advanced web design & devlopment, each in a surface-level way, you’ll get a chance to learn about some new technologies that make you tick—and then you’ll go and learn more yourself! Below is a basic schedule of the topics we’ll be covering over the next 10 weeks.


* Javascript
* Terminal
* Git & GitHub
* CSS Transitions & Animations
