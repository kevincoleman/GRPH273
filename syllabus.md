Welcome to Advanced Web Design! We’ll be covering a lot of varied topics during this course. You’ll be building on your HTML, CSS and Photoshop skills to become comfortable with much more than the basics. It’s my hope that by studying many different aspects of advanced web design & development, each in a surface-level way, you’ll get a chance to learn about some new technologies that make you tick—and then you can go learn more on your own.

## General Subjects
Over the next ten weeks, we’ll be covering these topics, plus a few fillers or extras if anyone requests something else they’ve discovered.

* Accessing Web Servers (& Zone Files)
* Javascript
* Unix Command & CSS Media Queries
* Git & GitHub
* Web Fonts
* Optimized Images
* CSS Transitions & Animations
* Client- vs. Server-side code
* Wordpress Templates


## Design Projects
You’ll also be doing a series of small design projects throughout the quarter. These will need to be client-ready Photoshop mockups, and we’ll use some of them to develop into case study sites. Some of the types of pages you’ll be designing are:

* Bio
* Gallery
* Contact Form
* Blog
* Long-form Reading
* Search Results
* Social profile
* Final Project (2 weeks)


## Quizzes
There will be a weekly quiz that covers the topic of the week (General Subjects). These Will be on D2L, and will open on Thursday after class is over. They will close On Tuesday before class starts, so you will have three non-Sabbath days to complete them. They are open book/web, and are meant mainly to help you know which key points I want to make sure you retain. However, they also contribute to your grade.


## Late Policy
All of the topic and design projects are due one week from the start of the class in which they were assigned. For example, a project assigned in class on a Thursday will be due *before* class the following Thursday. Late work may be marked down to any degree—or completely not accepted—at the instructor’s discretion. Pro tip: talk to me about your project if you think it will be late. If I understand why it’s late in advance I *may* be more willing to grade kindly.


## Grades
Your grades, like most, will be made up of your efforts put forth into the class (surprise)! Here’s a breakdown of how I’ll be structuring it:

* 20% Attendance & Participation
* 25% Projects from weekly topics
* 25% Design projects and critiques
* 20% Quizzes
* 10% Final Exam & Project

Each grade letter represents a range of 10 percentage points (A = 90–100, B = 80–89, etc.). Your grades will be updated as regularly as I can keep up with, and will be available on D2L.


## Final Exam
The final exam will consist of two parts: a written test, and a final project. Each of these will contribute equally to the Final Exam & Project section of your grade (5% each, for 10% of your total grade). You will be able to review your weekly quizzes to keep up on the exam content, and the final project will have its own description documentation. The final exam period takes place on June 9, 2015, from 7:00pm to 8:50pm in the Mac Lab in the Canaday Technology Center. Your project is due *at the start* of this period (turned in *before* 7:00pm), and your exam is due by the end of it (8:50pm).


## Disabilities
Those with physical and/or learning disabilities who require
special accommodations must inform the instructor and
coordinate alternative solutions with Sue Huett, Disability
Support Services in the Teaching Learning Center, Village
Hall, or at 527-2366.


## Faith & Learning
Central to the WWU mission is the integration of Faith
and Learning. This integration will be broadly approached.
Your professor may weave into the discussion various topics
such as ethics, mission work, service, and respect for God’s
creation. Adding your thoughts to these class discussions is
strongly encouraged.
